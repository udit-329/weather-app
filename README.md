# weather-app
This app aims to promote mental health during difficult times in this pandemic. We often stay indoors the entire day which negatively affects our mental health. 
Our app aims to change that by suggesting the best time to go out during the day, sending reminders for that and locating nearby places of interest.

We used Google places API and OpenWeatherMap api to get relevant information.


View the weather in any city, and the best time today to go out today.
Also locate nearby parks, spas, bakeries and more.
